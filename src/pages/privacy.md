### 1. What we collect  
* Email addresses you willingly provide when you join the newsletter or request ARCs.  
* Anonymous analytics data—page views, truncated IP addresses, browser type—via Google Analytics, which sets first-party cookies to do its job.  
* Aggregate demographic information supplied by Google Analytics.

### 2. How it’s used  
* To send you newsletters, bonus scenes, or ARC invitations.  
* To understand which pages resonate most and improve the site.

### 3. Third-party services  
* **EmailOctopus** – stores and processes your email address for newsletter distribution only.  
* **Google Analytics** – measures site traffic. IP-anonymisation is enabled and data is automatically deleted after 14 months. Google’s policy is [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

### 4. Opt-out  
Every newsletter footer includes a one-click **unsubscribe** link.  
To block analytics cookies entirely, install [Google’s opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) or disable cookies in your browser settings.  
Delete-me requests: email <hello@clarkquatermain.com> and we’ll purge your data within 72 hours.

### 5. Children  
This site isn’t directed to anyone under 13, and we don’t knowingly collect such data.

### 6. Changes to this policy  
If the policy changes, you’ll see the new date up top and—for major updates—receive an email alert.

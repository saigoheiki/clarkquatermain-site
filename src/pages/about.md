## Who’s this guy?

I write steamy, wilderness-tinged gay romance novellas.

Think flannel, firelight, and feelings your camping instructor never warned you about.

Off the page, you’ll catch me chasing sunrise along foggy ridgelines, sketching plot twists in a battered field notebook, or losing hours thumbing paperbacks in dusty corner shelves.

*Currently published:* **_Claimed by the Mountain Man_** (and more on the way).

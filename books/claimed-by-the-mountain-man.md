### Claimed by the Mountain Man

A city hiker, a grumpy mountain man, only one dry bed…

One wrong turn off an Oregon trail leaves city-tough but heart-bruised Cole shivering on a storm-soaked mountainside—until Reed, a reclusive, broad-shouldered logger, hauls him into a remote trapper cabin for the night. One creaking bed, crackling firelight, and a shared blanket turn survival into slow-burn heat that erupts fast: flannel peeled away, nerves laid bare, and no fade-to-black in sight. In this bite-size M/M wilderness romance, opposites collide, sparks ignite, and a hard-won happily-ever-after waits at first light—all in under an hour’s read.
